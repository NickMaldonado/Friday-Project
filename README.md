# PowerBall Number Generator Python Script

## Code Explanation:

1. `import random` - Imports the `random` module to generate random numbers.

2. `def generate_powerball_numbers():` - Defines a function named `generate_powerball_numbers` to encapsulate the PowerBall number generation logic.

3. `print("Welcome to the PowerBall number generator!")` - Prints a welcome message to the user.

4. `response = input("Would you like some PowerBall numbers? (yes/no): ")` - Prompts the user to input whether they want PowerBall numbers and stores their response in the variable `response`.

10. `print("Thank you for using the PowerBall number generator. Goodbye!")` - Prints a farewell message to the user.

11. `if __name__ == "__main__":` - Checks if the script is being run directly.

12. `generate_powerball_numbers()` - Calls the `generate_powerball_numbers()` function if the script is run directly, initiating the PowerBall number generation process.

# Trivia Question Study Program Python Script

2. `print("Welcome to the trivia question study program!")` - Prints a welcome message to the user.

3. `for question, answer in questions.items():` - Iterates through each question-answer pair in the dictionary.

4. `print("\nQuestion:", question)` - Prints the current question to the user.

5. `user_answer = input("Your answer: ")` - Prompts the user to input their answer to the current question and stores it in the variable `user_answer`.

6. `if user_answer.lower() == answer.lower():` - Checks if the user's answer (converted to lowercase) matches the correct answer (also converted to lowercase).

7. `print("Correct!")` - Prints a message indicating that the user's answer is correct.

8. `else:` - Executes if the user's answer is incorrect.

9. `print("Incorrect. The correct answer is:", answer)` - Prints a message indicating that the user's answer is incorrect and displays the correct answer.

10. `if __name__ == "__main__":` - Checks if the script is being run directly.

11. `trivia_questions = { ... }` - Defines a dictionary `trivia_questions` containing trivia questions as keys and their corresponding answers as values.
